Here is a detailed description of the given Python code:

**Function:** `filter_even_numbers`
**Description:** This function filters a list of numbers, keeping only the even numbers.

**How it works:**

The function takes one input parameter, `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers. The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list that includes only the even numbers from the original list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The function iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`.
2. For each number, it checks whether the number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). In Python, when you divide an integer by 2 and the remainder is 0, it means the number is even.
3. If the number is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), it includes that number in a new list.
4. The function returns this new list, which contains only the even numbers from the original input list.

**What problems does it solve?**

This function solves the problem of filtering out odd numbers from a list of integers. It's useful when you need to process or analyze only the even numbers from a dataset.

**Example usage:**

Suppose you have a list `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. If you call the function like this: `even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)`, the output would be `[2, 4, 6]`, which is the list of even numbers from the original input.

In summary, the `filter_even_numbers` function takes a list of integers as input, filters out odd numbers, and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. It's a simple but useful tool for data processing and analysis in Python!
