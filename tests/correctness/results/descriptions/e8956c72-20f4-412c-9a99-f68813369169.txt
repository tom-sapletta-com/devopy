Here's a detailed description of the code:

**What is this code doing?**

This Python code defines a function called `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, as input. The function attempts to divide `a` by `b` and returns the result. However, if `b` is zero (i.e., you're trying to divide by zero), the function catches the resulting error and instead returns a string indicating that division by zero is not allowed.

**How does it work?**

The code uses a `try-except` block to handle the potential exception that occurs when dividing by zero. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The `try` block attempts to execute the code inside it, which in this case is the division operation: `return a / b`. This line tries to perform the actual division.
2. If the division is successful (i.e., `b` is not zero), the function returns the result of the division as a floating-point number.
3. However, if `b` is exactly equal to zero, the division operation will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is caught by the `except` block.
4. The `except` block catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and instead returns a string indicating that division by zero is not allowed.

**What problems does this code solve?**

This code solves two main problems:

1. **Handling division by zero**: By catching the `ZeroDivisionError`, the code ensures that the program doesn't crash or produce an incorrect result when trying to divide by zero.
2. **Returning a meaningful error message**: When division by zero occurs, the code returns a helpful string indicating what went wrong, rather than simply crashing or returning an unexpected result.

**In summary**

The `divide_numbers` function is designed to safely perform divisions between two numbers, while also providing a useful error message when attempting to divide by zero. This ensures that your program remains stable and provides meaningful feedback in cases where division by zero occurs.
