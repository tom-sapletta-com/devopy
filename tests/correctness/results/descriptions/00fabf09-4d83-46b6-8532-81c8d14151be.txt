Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a single function called `add_numbers` that takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, as input. The function adds these two numbers together and returns the result.

**How does it work?**

The `add_numbers` function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses containing the input parameters (in this case, `a` and `b`). The triple quotes (`"""..."""`) are used to provide a docstring that describes what the function does.

Inside the function, there's only one line of code: `return a + b`. This line uses Python's built-in addition operator (+) to add the values of `a` and `b`, and then returns the result using the `return` statement.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves a simple but common problem in programming: adding two numbers together. It provides a reusable function that can be used in various parts of your program, making your code more organized and efficient.

**How is it useful?**

The `add_numbers` function can be used in many situations where you need to combine the values of two variables. For example:

* When calculating the total cost of items in an e-commerce system
* When combining scores from different tests or quizzes
* When determining the sum of dimensions for a geometric shape

By using this function, you can avoid writing duplicate code and make your program more readable and maintainable.

**In summary**

The `add_numbers` function is a simple but useful tool that adds two numbers together and returns the result. It's a great example of how Python's concise syntax and built-in operators can help you solve common problems in a straightforward way.
