Here is a detailed description of the code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a simple function in Python called `add_numbers`. This function takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, as input and returns their sum.

**How does it work?**

The code uses a concept called "function" which is a block of code that can be executed multiple times from different parts of your program. In this case, the function is named `add_numbers`.

When you call the `add_numbers` function with two numbers, say `2` and `3`, it will execute the code inside the function. The code simply adds the two input numbers together using the `+` operator.

The result of the addition is then returned to the caller of the function. This means that if you use the `add_numbers` function in a larger program, you can get the sum of two numbers by calling the function and assigning its return value to a variable.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves a simple problem: how to add two numbers together. It provides a reusable piece of code that can be used multiple times in your program without having to rewrite the same addition logic each time.

For example, if you have a program that needs to calculate the total cost of two items, you could use this `add_numbers` function to get the sum of their prices. This makes your code more modular and easier to maintain.

**How is it used?**

To use this code, you would call the `add_numbers` function with two numbers as arguments, like this:
```python
result = add_numbers(2, 3)
print(result)  # prints 5
```
This code would execute the `add_numbers` function and store its return value in a variable named `result`. You could then print or use this result in your program.

Overall, this simple code provides a reusable way to add two numbers together, making it a useful building block for larger programs.
