Here's a detailed description of the code:

**Function Name:** `filter_even_numbers`
**Purpose:** This function filters out even numbers from an input list and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.

**Code Explanation:**

The function takes one argument, `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers. The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list that contains only the even numbers from the original list.

Here's how it works:

1. `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]`: This is the list comprehension part. It's saying: "For each number `num` in the input list `numbers`, check if `num` is even (i.e., if `num % 2 == 0`). If it is, add `num` to a new list."
2. The `if num % 2 == 0` part is the condition for including a number in the new list. It checks if the remainder of dividing `num` by 2 is equal to 0. In other words, it checks if `num` is even.
3. The `return [ ... ]` statement returns the resulting list of even numbers.

**What the code does:**

When you call this function with a list of integers as an argument, it will return a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. For example:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```
**Problems solved:**

This code solves the problem of filtering out even numbers from a list. This is useful when you need to process or analyze only the even numbers in a dataset.

**How it works:**

The code uses list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list by iterating over an existing list and applying a condition to each element. The `num % 2 == 0` condition checks if a number is even, and if it is, the number is added to the new list.

Overall, this code is a simple yet effective solution for filtering out even numbers from a list in Python.
