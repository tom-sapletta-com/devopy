Here is a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How does it work?**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list. List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python by iterating over an iterable (such as a list or tuple) and applying a condition to each element.

In this case, the code iterates over the input list `numbers` and checks if each number is even using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. The `%` operator calculates the remainder of the division of `num` by 2. If the result is 0, it means that `num` is an even number.

The code then uses a syntax like `[expression for variable in iterable]` to create a new list containing only the numbers that satisfy the condition (i.e., are even). The expression inside the brackets is simply `num`, which is the value of each number in the original list.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves the problem of filtering out odd numbers from a list, leaving only the even numbers. This can be useful in many scenarios, such as:

* Cleaning up a dataset to remove outliers or irregularities
* Filtering a list of values based on some condition
* Creating a new list with specific characteristics

**How does it compare to other solutions?**

This code is concise and efficient compared to traditional looping methods. It also makes the code more readable and maintainable, as the intent of the function is clearly expressed in the code.

In contrast, a non-list comprehension solution might look like this:
```python
def filter_even_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_numbers.append(num)
    return even_numbers
```
While this code is still readable and functional, the list comprehension version is more concise and expressive.
