Here is the detailed description of the provided Python code:

**What does the code do?**

This code defines a simple function called `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as input, adds them together, and returns the result.

**How does it work?**

The function is defined with two parameters: `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numeric values (integers or floats). The function's purpose is to add these two numbers together and return the resulting sum.

 Inside the function, there is only one statement: `return a + b`. This line uses Python's built-in addition operator (`+`) to combine the values of `a` and `b`, and then returns the result using the `return` keyword.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves a very basic problem: adding two numbers together. In real-world applications, you might need to perform arithmetic operations on user-input data or process mathematical calculations in various contexts (e.g., finance, science, or engineering). This simple function provides a straightforward way to accomplish this task.

**How does it work with different inputs?**

You can call the `add_numbers` function by passing two numeric values as arguments. For example:
```python
result = add_numbers(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```
In this case, the function adds 2 and 3 together, returning the result (5). You can use this function with various input combinations to perform different arithmetic operations.

**Conclusion**

The `add_numbers` function is a simple yet useful piece of code that demonstrates basic Python programming concepts. By understanding how this code works, you can build upon it to create more complex and powerful algorithms for solving real-world problems.
