Here's a detailed explanation of the Python code:

**Code:** `filter_even_numbers(numbers)`

**What does it do?**
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How does it work?**

The function uses a concept called "list comprehension" to achieve this. List comprehension is a concise way to create a new list by iterating over an existing list (or other iterable) and applying a filter or transformation to each element.

In this case, the code uses the following syntax:
```python
[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
```
Let's break it down:

* `[num ...]` is the new list that will be created.
* `for num in numbers` iterates over each number in the input list (`numbers`).
* `if num % 2 == 0` is the filter condition. It checks whether each number is even (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is 0). If the number passes this test, it will be included in the new list.

**What problems does it solve?**

This function helps to:

* Filter out odd numbers from a list of mixed numbers.
* Create a new list containing only even numbers, which can be useful in various applications, such as data processing or statistical analysis.

**How does it handle different types of inputs?**

The function is designed to work with lists of integers. If the input is not a list or contains non-integer values, the function will raise an error. For example:

* If the input is not a list (`filter_even_numbers(5)`, for instance), Python will raise a `TypeError`.
* If the input list contains non-integer values (e.g., strings or floats), the function will also raise an error.

Overall, this function provides a simple and efficient way to extract even numbers from a list, making it a useful tool in various programming contexts.
