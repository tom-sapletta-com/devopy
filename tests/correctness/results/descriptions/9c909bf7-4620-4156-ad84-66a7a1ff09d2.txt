I'd be happy to help!

The code is a function named `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

Here's how it works:

1. The function defines a parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
2. Inside the function, there's a list comprehension (a shorthand way to create lists) that iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`.
3. For each number, the code checks whether it's even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is 0, then the number is even.
4. The list comprehension only includes numbers that meet this condition (i.e., are even) and returns a new list containing these numbers.

In other words, this function filters out all the odd numbers from the input list and returns a new list with only the even numbers.

For example, if you call the function like this: `filter_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`, it will return the list `[2, 4, 6]`.

This code is useful when you need to extract a specific subset of data from a larger dataset. In this case, it's extracting all the even numbers from a list of numbers.

No complex problems are solved by this code; instead, it provides a simple and efficient way to filter out odd numbers from a list.
