Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**What is this code doing?**

This code defines a simple function called `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as input, adds them together, and returns the result.

**How does it work?**

The code consists of a single line: `return a + b`. This line says that when you call the `add_numbers` function with two arguments (let's call them `a` and `b`), it will add those numbers together and return the result as the output of the function.

**What are the key functions?**

The main function in this code is `add_numbers`, which performs the addition operation. There are no other functions or operations involved in this code.

**How does it solve problems?**

This code solves a very basic problem: adding two numbers together and getting the result. This might seem trivial, but think about all the times you need to add two numbers in your daily life - for example, when calculating tips at a restaurant or calculating your monthly expenses. This code provides a simple way to do just that.

**How does it work behind the scenes?**

When you call the `add_numbers` function with two arguments (like `2` and `3`), Python's interpreter will:

1. Take the two input numbers (`a` and `b`) and store them in memory.
2. Execute the line `return a + b`, which adds the two numbers together using the built-in `+` operator.
3. Return the result of the addition as the output of the function.

In summary, this code defines a simple `add_numbers` function that takes two numbers, adds them together, and returns the result. It's a basic but useful tool for anyone who needs to perform arithmetic operations in Python!
