Here's a detailed description of the Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How does it work?**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list. List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python by iterating over an existing list or other iterable, applying a filter or transformation to each item, and collecting the results in a new list.

In this specific code, the list comprehension iterates over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`. For each number, it checks whether the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is equal to 0 (i.e., whether the number is even). If the condition is true, the number is included in the new list.

**What's the purpose of this code?**

The main purpose of this code is to simplify the process of filtering out odd numbers from a list. It can be useful when working with datasets or lists that contain a mix of even and odd values, and you only want to work with the even ones.

**How does it solve problems?**

This code solves the problem of finding all even numbers in a given list. Without this code, you would have to manually iterate over the list, check each number individually, and create a new list by hand. This code automates that process, making it more efficient and concise.

**How does it work under the hood?**

When you call the `filter_even_numbers` function with an input list, Python creates a temporary list comprehension object behind the scenes. The object iterates over each number in the input list, applies the condition (`num % 2 == 0`), and adds the even numbers to the new list.

Python then returns the resulting list as the output of the `filter_even_numbers` function.

In summary, this code is a concise way to filter out odd numbers from a list, making it easier to work with datasets or lists that contain a mix of even and odd values.
