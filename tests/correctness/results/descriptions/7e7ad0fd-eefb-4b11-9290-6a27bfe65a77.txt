Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**Function `divide_numbers(a, b)`**

This is a simple function that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be numbers (e.g., integers or floats). The function's primary task is to divide `a` by `b`. However, it also includes some error handling to prevent unexpected behavior when dividing by zero.

**Try-Except Block**

The code uses a try-except block to attempt the division and catch any potential errors. Here's what happens:

1. **Try**: The function tries to execute the line `return a / b`, which is the actual division operation.
2. **Except (ZeroDivisionError)**: If an error occurs during the division, specifically a `ZeroDivisionError` (which is raised when trying to divide by zero), the code jumps to the except block.

**Return Values**

The function returns either:

1. The result of the division (`a / b`) if no errors occur.
2. A string `"Nie można dzielić przez zero"` (Polish for "Cannot be divided by zero") when a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised.

**What does the code do?**

In summary, this code is designed to:

1. Take two numbers (`a` and `b`) as input.
2. Attempt to divide `a` by `b`.
3. Handle the case where `b` is zero (i.e., division by zero) by returning a friendly error message.

**What problems does it solve?**

By including error handling for division by zero, this code:

1. Prevents unexpected behavior or crashes when attempting to divide by zero.
2. Provides a clear and informative response to the user in such cases.

Overall, this code demonstrates good programming practices, such as using try-except blocks to handle potential errors and providing helpful feedback to users.
