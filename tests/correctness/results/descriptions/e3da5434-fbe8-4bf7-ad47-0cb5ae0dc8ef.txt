Here is a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, as inputs. The function's main purpose is to divide the first number (`a`) by the second number (`b`). However, it also handles a special case where the division would result in an error (i.e., dividing by zero).

**How does the code work?**

The code uses a try-except block to achieve its goal. Here's what happens:

1. The function attempts to divide `a` by `b` using the `/` operator. This is the "try" part.
2. If the division is successful, the result is returned as the output of the function.
3. However, if the division would result in an error (i.e., dividing by zero), a `ZeroDivisionError` exception is raised.
4. The code catches this exception using an `except` block and returns a special message: "Nie można dzielić przez zero" (which means "You can't divide by zero" in Polish).

**What problems does the code solve?**

The code solves two main problems:

1. **Handling division by zero errors**: By catching the `ZeroDivisionError`, the code ensures that the function doesn't crash or produce unexpected results when attempting to divide by zero.
2. **Returning a meaningful error message**: Instead of returning an error message like "invalid input" or "error occurred", the code provides a clear and informative message that explains what went wrong (i.e., dividing by zero).

**In summary**

The `divide_numbers` function is designed to safely handle division operations, particularly when dealing with potential errors like dividing by zero. By using try-except blocks, the code ensures that the function remains robust and produces meaningful error messages when unexpected situations arise.
