Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `divide_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be numbers. The function is designed to divide `a` by `b` and return the result.

**How does it work?**

The function uses a try-except block to handle the possibility of dividing by zero. This is because division by zero is undefined in mathematics and would typically raise an error.

Here's what happens when you call the function:

1. The function tries to execute the code inside the `try` block, which is simply the division operation: `a / b`.
2. If the division is successful, the result is returned.
3. However, if `b` is zero (i.e., you're trying to divide by zero), a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised.
4. The `except` block catches this error and returns a string indicating that dividing by zero is not allowed.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves the problem of handling division by zero, which can be a common mistake in programming. By catching the `ZeroDivisionError`, the function ensures that the program doesn't crash or produce unexpected results when attempting to divide by zero.

**How is it useful?**

This code is useful in situations where you need to perform divisions and want to ensure that your program handles errors gracefully. For example, you might use this function in a calculator program or a mathematical model where division by zero would be an invalid operation.

In summary, the `divide_numbers` function is a simple but effective way to handle division operations while preventing crashes and unexpected results when dividing by zero.
