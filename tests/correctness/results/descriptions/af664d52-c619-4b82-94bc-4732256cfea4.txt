Here's a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**Function Name:** `filter_even_numbers`
**Input:** A list of numbers (`numbers`)
**Output:** A new list containing only even numbers from the original input list.

This function uses a concept called "list comprehension" to filter out odd numbers from the input list and return a new list with only even numbers. Let's break it down:

1. The function takes a list of numbers as input, which is stored in the variable `numbers`.
2. The function returns a new list using a list comprehension. This is denoted by the square brackets `[]` and the `for` loop.
3. Inside the list comprehension, we use an `if` statement to check if each number (`num`) in the input list is even. We do this by checking if the remainder of dividing the number by 2 (`num % 2`) is equal to 0.

In simple terms, the function asks: "Is each number in the input list even?" If the answer is yes, it adds that number to the new list. If the answer is no (i.e., the number is odd), it skips that number and moves on to the next one.

**What the code does:**

The `filter_even_numbers` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only even numbers from the original input list. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

* Filtering out odd numbers from a dataset to analyze only the even values.
* Generating a list of even numbers for further processing or calculation.
* Simplifying code by removing unnecessary iterations over the input data.

**Common use cases:**

1. Data analysis: When working with datasets containing numerical values, you might need to filter out odd numbers to focus on specific patterns or trends.
2. Algorithm development: You can use this function as a building block for more complex algorithms that require filtering even numbers from a dataset.
3. Education: This code is an excellent example of list comprehension in Python, making it suitable for teaching beginners about the power of functional programming.

In summary, the `filter_even_numbers` function is a simple yet effective tool for filtering out odd numbers from a list and returning a new list containing only even numbers.
