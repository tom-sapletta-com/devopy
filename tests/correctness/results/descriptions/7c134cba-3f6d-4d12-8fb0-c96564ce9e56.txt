Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

**What does the code do?**

This code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How does it work?**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list. A list comprehension is a concise way to create a new list by iterating over an existing list and applying a condition to each element.

In this case, the list comprehension iterates over the input list `numbers`, checks if each number is even (using the modulo operator `%`), and only includes the numbers that meet the condition (`num % 2 == 0`). This effectively filters out the odd numbers from the original list.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves a common problem in data processing: filtering out unwanted values from a dataset. In this case, it helps to remove odd numbers from a list, which can be useful when working with numerical data that only needs to include even values (e.g., in calculations or statistical analysis).

**Key concepts explained:**

1. **Functions**: The code defines a function `filter_even_numbers` that takes an input and returns a value. This is the basic building block of programming.
2. **List comprehensions**: The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list. This is a concise way to iterate over a list and apply a condition to each element.
3. **Modulo operator (`%`)**: The code uses the modulo operator to check if a number is even (i.e., divisible by 2). This is a fundamental concept in programming.

Overall, this code demonstrates a practical application of Python's syntax and data structures to solve a common problem.
