Here's the detailed description of the provided Python code:

**Code:** `add_numbers(a, b)`

**Functionality:** The `add_numbers` function is designed to take two numerical inputs (`a` and `b`) and return their sum.

**How it works:**

1. When you call the `add_numbers` function with two arguments (e.g., `add_numbers(2, 3)`), Python executes the code inside this function.
2. The function uses a simple arithmetic operation to add the input values (`a` and `b`) together.
3. The result of the addition is then returned by the function.

**Key aspects:**

* **Input parameters:** The function takes two numerical inputs, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be integers or floating-point numbers.
* **Return value:** The function returns a single value, which is the sum of the input values (`a` and `b`).

**What does it do?**

The `add_numbers` function solves a simple arithmetic problem: adding two numbers together. It's useful when you need to perform basic calculations in your code.

**Example usage:**

Suppose you want to calculate the total cost of two items, each with its own price (e.g., $2 and $3). You can use this function like this:
```python
price1 = 2
price2 = 3

total_price = add_numbers(price1, price2)
print(total_price)  # Output: 5
```

**No issues to resolve:** Since the code is simple and well-structured, there are no specific problems or errors that need to be addressed.
