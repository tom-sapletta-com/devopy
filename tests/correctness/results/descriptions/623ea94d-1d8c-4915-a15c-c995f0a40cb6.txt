Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

**Code:** `filter_even_numbers(numbers)`

**Functionality:** This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How it works:**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list. A list comprehension is a concise way to create a new list by iterating over an existing list and applying a condition or transformation to each element.

In this case, the function iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`. For each number, it checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator `% 2 == 0`. If the number is even (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 0), then it includes that number in the new list.

The function returns this new list of even numbers.

**Example usage:**

Let's say we have a list `numbers` containing the numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. We can call the `filter_even_numbers` function like this:
```python
even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```
**What problem does it solve?**

This code solves the problem of filtering out odd numbers from a list and returning only the even numbers. This is useful when you need to process or analyze only certain types of data.

**How does it work under the hood?**

When we call the `filter_even_numbers` function, Python creates a new list by iterating over each element in the input list `numbers`. For each element, it applies the condition `num % 2 == 0`, which checks if the number is even. If the condition is true, then the element is included in the new list.

The resulting list contains only the even numbers from the original list, and this new list is returned by the function.

Overall, this code demonstrates a simple yet powerful technique for filtering data using Python's built-in list comprehension syntax.
