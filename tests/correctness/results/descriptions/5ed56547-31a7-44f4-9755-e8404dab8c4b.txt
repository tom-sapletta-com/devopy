Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How does it work?**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list. A list comprehension is a concise way to create a new list by iterating over an existing list (or other iterable) and applying some condition or transformation to each element.

In this case, the list comprehension looks like this: `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]`. Let's break it down:

* `num for num in numbers`: This part iterates over the input list `numbers`, assigning each number to a variable called `num`.
* `if num % 2 == 0`: This is the condition that determines which numbers are included in the new list. The `%` operator computes the remainder of dividing `num` by 2. If the result is 0, it means that `num` is even.

**What problems does the code solve?**

The code solves the problem of filtering out odd numbers from a list of integers. This can be useful in various situations, such as:

* When working with large datasets and you need to process only certain types of data (e.g., even numbers).
* When you need to transform or manipulate data in some way, and you want to focus on specific subsets of the data.

**How does the code compare to other solutions?**

This code is a simple and efficient solution compared to more complex approaches. For example, you could use a traditional for loop with an if statement to achieve the same result:
```python
def filter_even_numbers(numbers):
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            result.append(num)
    return result
```
However, the list comprehension version is more concise and easier to read.
