Here is a detailed description of the provided Python code:

**Function:** `filter_even_numbers(numbers)`

**Description:** This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How it works:**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list with only the even numbers. The general syntax for this is: `[expression for variable in iterable]`. In this case, the expression is `num`, which represents each number in the input list, and the iterable is the input list itself (`numbers`).

**What it does:**

The function iterates over each number in the input list. For each number, it checks whether the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is equal to 0 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the result is 0, that means the number is even.

If a number is even, the function adds it to the new list being created. The resulting list only contains the even numbers from the original input list.

**Example usage:**

Let's say you have a list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. If you pass this list to the `filter_even_numbers` function, it will return the list `[2, 4, 6]`, which contains only the even numbers from the original list.

**Benefits:**

This code is useful when you need to extract a specific subset of data (in this case, even numbers) from a larger dataset. It's also an efficient way to process large lists, as it doesn't require creating unnecessary intermediate results.

Overall, this code demonstrates a simple yet powerful technique for filtering data in Python, making it easy to work with and manipulate datasets.
