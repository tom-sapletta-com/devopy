Here is a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**Code Overview**

The code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**Function Explanation**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list. List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python by iterating over an iterable (such as a list or tuple) and performing some operation on each element.

In this case, the function iterates over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`. For each number, it checks whether the number is even by using the modulo operator `%`, which returns the remainder of the division. If the remainder is 0 (i.e., the number is even), then the number is included in the new list.

The function uses a simple if statement to filter out odd numbers: `if num % 2 == 0`. This checks whether the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is equal to 0, which is only true for even numbers. If the condition is met, the number is added to the new list.

**How it Works**

Here's an example of how the function works:

Suppose you have a list `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. When you call the `filter_even_numbers` function with this input, here's what happens:

1. The function iterates over each number in the input list.
2. For each number, it checks whether the number is even by using the modulo operator `%`.
3. If the number is even (i.e., the remainder is 0), then it adds the number to a new list.
4. After iterating over all numbers, the function returns the new list containing only the even numbers.

In this case, the output would be `[2, 4, 6]`.

**Solving Problems**

This code solves the problem of filtering out odd numbers from a list. It's useful when you need to extract specific data (in this case, even numbers) from a larger dataset (the input list).

By using a list comprehension, the function is concise and efficient, making it easy to use in your own programs.

**Conclusion**

In summary, the `filter_even_numbers` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. It uses list comprehensions and simple conditional statements to achieve this, making it a useful tool for filtering data in Python.
