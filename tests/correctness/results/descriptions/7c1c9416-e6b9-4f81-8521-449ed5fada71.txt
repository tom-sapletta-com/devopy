Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, as input. The function attempts to divide `a` by `b` and return the result. However, it also handles the situation where `b` is zero (i.e., division by zero), which would normally raise an error.

**How does the code work?**

The code uses a `try`-`except` block to catch any potential errors that might occur during the execution of the function. Specifically, it catches a `ZeroDivisionError`, which is raised when attempting to divide by zero.

Here's what happens step by step:

1. The function is called with two numbers, `a` and `b`, as input.
2. The code attempts to divide `a` by `b` using the `/` operator.
3. If `b` is non-zero, the division operation completes successfully, and the result is returned.
4. If `b` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised.
5. The `except` block catches this error and executes the code within it.
6. In this case, the code returns a string indicating that it's not possible to divide by zero.

**What problems does the code solve?**

The code solves two main problems:

1. **Division by zero**: By catching the `ZeroDivisionError`, the code prevents the program from crashing when attempting to divide by zero.
2. **Clear error handling**: The code returns a clear and informative message when division by zero occurs, rather than raising an error or returning an unexpected result.

**In summary**

The `divide_numbers` function is a simple yet useful piece of code that handles the common scenario where you need to divide two numbers but want to prevent errors from occurring. It's a great example of how Python's `try`-`except` block can be used to catch and handle specific exceptions, making your code more robust and user-friendly.
