Here's a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**What does the code do?**
The code defines a function called `divide_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. This function is designed to divide two numbers, but with an important twist - it also handles the case where the second number (`b`) is zero.

**How does it work?**

1. The function starts by trying to divide the first number (`a`) by the second number (`b`). This is done using the `/` operator.
2. If the division is successful, the result is returned as a value from the function.
3. However, if `b` is zero, the division will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is a built-in Python exception that's raised when you try to divide by zero.

**What happens next?**

4. When the `ZeroDivisionError` is raised, the code inside the `except` block is executed.
5. In this case, the code returns a string message "Nie można dzielić przez zero", which translates to "Can't divide by zero" in Polish.

**Why was this code written?**
This code was likely written to handle a common error that can occur when dividing numbers - attempting to divide by zero. By catching and handling this exception, the function provides a more robust way of dealing with invalid input (in this case, trying to divide by zero).

**What are some benefits of this code?**

* It prevents the program from crashing or producing an unexpected error when trying to divide by zero.
* It provides a clear and informative message to the user about what went wrong.
* It allows the function to be used in situations where it's possible that the second number (`b`) might be zero, but you still want to handle the division operation safely.

Overall, this code is a great example of how to write robust and error-handling code in Python.
