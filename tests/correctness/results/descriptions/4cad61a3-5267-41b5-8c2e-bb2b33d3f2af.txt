Here is a detailed description of the Python code:

**What does this code do?**

This code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How does it work?**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list. List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python. They consist of an expression followed by a `for` loop that iterates over some data (in this case, the input list `numbers`).

Here's what happens step-by-step:

1. The function iterates over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`.
2. For each number, it checks whether the number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). In Python, the remainder of dividing a number by 2 is 0 if the number is even.
3. If the number is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), it adds that number to the new list.
4. The function returns the resulting list of even numbers.

**What problems does this code solve?**

This code solves a common problem in data processing: filtering out unwanted values from a dataset. In this case, it helps you isolate only the even numbers from a larger list of numbers.

**How can I use this code?**

You can use this code to filter out even numbers from any list of numbers. For example:

* If you have a list of exam scores and you want to see only the scores that are 40 or above, you could pass that list to `filter_even_numbers` and get back a new list containing only the even scores (i.e., 40, 60, 80, etc.).
* If you have a list of ages and you want to see only the people who are older than 30, you could pass that list to `filter_even_numbers` and get back a new list containing only the ages that are multiples of 2 (i.e., 32, 42, 52, etc.).

Overall, this code is a useful tool for simplifying data analysis and making it easier to work with lists of numbers.
