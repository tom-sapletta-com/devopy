Here's a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**Function:** `add_numbers`
**Purpose:** To add two numbers together and return the result.

**What it does:**

The `add_numbers` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numerical values (integers or floats). The function simply adds these two numbers together using the `+` operator and returns the resulting value.

**How it works:**

When you call the `add_numbers` function with two numbers, say `2` and `3`, the code executes as follows:

1. The function receives the input values `a=2` and `b=3`.
2. The `return` statement is executed, which adds `a` (2) and `b` (3) together using the `+` operator.
3. The result of the addition (`5`) is returned by the function.

**What it solves:**

This simple function solves a common problem in programming: adding two numbers together. It's a basic building block for more complex calculations and can be used in various contexts, such as:

* Calculating totals or sums
* Performing arithmetic operations in algorithms
* Creating numerical transformations

**How to use it:**

To use this function, you can simply call it with two numerical arguments, like this:
```python
result = add_numbers(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```
This code would output `5`, which is the result of adding `2` and `3`.

In summary, the `add_numbers` function is a simple yet useful tool for adding two numbers together. It's easy to understand and use, making it a great starting point for beginners in programming.
