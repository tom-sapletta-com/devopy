Here's a detailed explanation of the Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How does it work?**

The function uses a concept called "list comprehension" to create a new list. List comprehensions are a shorthand way to create lists in Python. They consist of an expression followed by a `for` clause, which iterates over some iterable (in this case, the input list `numbers`). The expression is evaluated for each item in the iterable, and the resulting values are collected into a new list.

In this specific code, the expression is `num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0`. This means that for each number `num` in the original list `numbers`, check if it's even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is 0 (i.e., the number is even), then include it in the new list.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves a common problem in data processing: filtering out unwanted values from a dataset. In this case, the unwanted values are odd numbers, and we only want to keep the even ones.

The function is useful when working with lists of numbers that contain both even and odd values, and you need to extract only the even numbers for further analysis or processing.

**How does it compare to other solutions?**

This code is a simple and efficient way to filter out even numbers from a list. It's more readable and maintainable than alternative solutions, such as using a `for` loop with an `if` statement to build the new list manually.

In summary, this code defines a function that filters out odd numbers from a list of numbers, leaving only the even ones. It uses list comprehensions for brevity and efficiency, making it a useful tool in data processing tasks.
