Here's a detailed explanation of the Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How does it work?**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list with only the even numbers. Here's how:

1. The code starts by iterating over each number in the input list `numbers` using the `for num in numbers` syntax.
2. For each number, it checks whether the number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is 0 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), then the number is even.
3. The code uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even numbers. This is done using the syntax `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]`.
4. The resulting list of even numbers is returned by the function.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves the problem of filtering out odd numbers from a list, leaving you with only the even numbers. This can be useful when working with data that contains both even and odd values, such as in statistics or data analysis.

**How does it work under the hood?**

When you call the function with an input list, Python will iterate over each element of the list and perform the calculation `num % 2 == 0` for each number. This involves some basic arithmetic operations (modulus) and a simple comparison (equal to 0). The resulting list comprehension creates a new list containing only the even numbers.

**Tips and Variations**

* You can use this function as a starting point and modify it to filter out other types of values, such as strings or booleans.
* If you want to filter out even numbers in a more complex way (e.g., based on additional conditions), you can add more clauses to the list comprehension using `if` statements.
* This code assumes that the input list contains only integers. If your data includes other types of values, you may need to modify the function accordingly.

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to filter out even numbers from a list in Python.
