Here's a detailed explanation of the Python code:

**Code Overview**
The code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**Function Name and Purpose**
The name `filter_even_numbers` indicates that this function is designed to filter out certain elements (in this case, odd numbers) from a given collection of data. The purpose of this function is to simplify the process of finding all the even numbers in a large dataset by providing a concise way to extract only those numbers.

**Function Implementation**
The implementation of `filter_even_numbers` uses a technique called list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list from an existing iterable (like a list or tuple) by applying a condition to each element. In this case, the condition is `num % 2 == 0`, which checks whether a number is even.

Here's how it works:

1. The function takes a list of numbers as input, represented by the variable `numbers`.
2. The list comprehension iterates over each number in the input list.
3. For each number, it applies the condition `num % 2 == 0`, which checks whether the number is even (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 0).
4. If the condition is true, the number is included in the new list.
5. The resulting list of even numbers is returned as the output of the function.

**How it Works**
To illustrate how this function works, let's consider an example input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. When we pass this list to `filter_even_numbers`, here's what happens:

* The function iterates over each number in the input list: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`.
* For each number, it applies the condition `num % 2 == 0`. Here are the results:
	+ `1`: remainder when divided by 2 is 1, so it's not even.
	+ `2`: remainder when divided by 2 is 0, so it's even.
	+ `3`: remainder when divided by 2 is 1, so it's not even.
	+ `4`: remainder when divided by 2 is 0, so it's even.
	+ `5`: remainder when divided by 2 is 1, so it's not even.
	+ `6`: remainder when divided by 2 is 0, so it's even.
* The function collects all the numbers that pass the condition (i.e., the even numbers) and returns them as a new list: `[2, 4, 6]`.

**Benefits**
This code has several benefits:

* It simplifies the process of finding even numbers in a large dataset by providing a concise way to extract only those numbers.
* It's efficient, as it uses a list comprehension that iterates over the input list only once.
* It's easy to understand and maintain, as the logic is straightforward and the code is concise.

In summary, this code defines a function `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and apply a condition to each number, selecting only those that are even.
