Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**Function:** `add_numbers`
**Purpose:** To add two numbers together and return the result.

**Code Breakdown:**

The code defines a single function called `add_numbers`, which takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. These arguments are expected to be numerical values (e.g., integers or floats).

**How it works:**

1. The function is defined with a docstring (`"""Dodaje dwie liczby i zwraca wynik."""`) that provides a brief description of what the function does.
2. The `return` statement inside the function adds the two input numbers together using the `+` operator and returns the result.

**What it does:**

The `add_numbers` function takes in two numbers, performs an addition operation on them, and then returns the resulting sum. This is a simple arithmetic operation that can be used in various scenarios, such as:

* Calculating the total of two quantities
* Combining values from different sources
* Performing calculations for data analysis or scientific computing

**Problems it solves:**

This code helps solve the problem of needing to perform a simple addition operation on two numerical values. It provides a reusable and straightforward way to add numbers together, making it easy to incorporate into larger programs.

**How it works under the hood:**

When you call the `add_numbers` function with two input values, such as `2` and `3`, the code executes the following steps:

1. The function receives the input values, `a` and `b`.
2. The function adds the input values together using the `+` operator.
3. The result of the addition is returned to the caller.

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to perform basic arithmetic operations in Python.
