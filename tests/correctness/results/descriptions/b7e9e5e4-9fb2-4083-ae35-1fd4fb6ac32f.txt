Here's a detailed description of the provided Python code:

**What does the code do?**

This code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How does it work?**

The code uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create the new list. This is a concise way to create a new list by iterating over an existing iterable (like a list) and selecting specific elements that meet certain conditions.

In this case, the condition is `num % 2 == 0`, which checks whether each number in the input list is even (i.e., divisible by 2). If a number is even, it's included in the new list. If a number is odd, it's excluded from the new list.

**What problem does this code solve?**

This code solves the problem of filtering out odd numbers from an input list, leaving only the even numbers behind. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

* Data analysis: When working with large datasets, you might want to focus on specific subsets of data (e.g., all the even numbers in a range).
* Algorithm development: In algorithms that rely on even numbers, you need to ensure that only even numbers are processed.
* General-purpose programming: This code can be used as a building block for more complex programs that require filtering or transforming data.

**How does it handle different types of input?**

The `filter_even_numbers` function is designed to work with lists of integers. If the input list contains non-integer values (e.g., strings, floats), the code will raise an error when trying to perform the modulo operation (`num % 2 == 0`). To make the code more robust, you could add input validation or type checking using Python's built-in `isinstance()` function.

Overall, this code is a simple but effective way to filter out odd numbers from an input list, making it a useful tool in any Python programmer's toolkit!
