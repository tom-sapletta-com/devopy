Here's a detailed description of the given Python code:

**Function:** `divide_numbers(a, b)`

**Description:** This function takes two numbers as input and returns their division result. However, it also handles the special case where the second number (denominator) is zero, which would normally cause a math error.

**How it works:**

1. The function accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numerical values.
2. Inside the function, there's a `try` block that attempts to perform the division operation using the `/` operator.
3. If the division is successful (i.e., the second number is not zero), the result is returned as the output of the function.
4. However, if the division attempt raises a `ZeroDivisionError`, which occurs when trying to divide by zero, the code catches this exception and executes the code inside the `except` block instead.
5. In the `except` block, a string message "Nie można dzielić przez zero" (Polish for "Can't divide by zero") is returned as the output of the function.

**What it does:** This code provides a safe way to perform division operations without crashing when trying to divide by zero. It's useful in situations where you need to validate user input or handle unexpected edge cases.

**Problems solved:**

* Avoids math errors caused by dividing by zero
* Provides informative error messages for invalid inputs
* Allows for robust and predictable behavior in the face of unexpected inputs

Overall, this code is a great example of how Python's `try`-`except` block can be used to handle and recover from exceptional situations, making your code more reliable and user-friendly.
