Here is a detailed description of the given Python code:

**Code Explanation**

The provided code defines a simple function called `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numbers (integers or floats). The function adds these two numbers together and returns the result.

**What the Code Does**

When you call the `add_numbers` function with two numerical values as arguments, it will perform the following actions:

1. It takes the first value (`a`) and the second value (`b`) as input.
2. It calculates the sum of these two values by adding them together (e.g., `a + b`).
3. It returns the resulting sum as the output of the function.

**Example Usage**

Here's an example of how you could use this code:
```python
result = add_numbers(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```
In this example, we call the `add_numbers` function with arguments `2` and `3`, and it returns the sum `5`.

**What Problems does this Code Solve?**

This code solves a simple mathematical problem by providing a reusable function to add two numbers together. This can be useful in various scenarios where you need to perform arithmetic operations on data.

**How does it Work?**

The code works by using Python's built-in addition operator (`+`) to combine the values of `a` and `b`. The `return` statement then passes this calculated sum back out of the function, making it available for further use in your program.

Overall, this code is a basic example of how you can define a reusable function in Python to perform a specific task.
