Here is a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How does it work?**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list. This is a concise way to create a list by iterating over an existing iterable (such as a list) and applying a condition or transformation to each element.

In this specific case, the code iterates over each number (`num`) in the input list `numbers`. For each number, it checks whether the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is equal to 0 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the condition is true (i.e., the number is even), the number is included in the new list.

**What are the main features of this code?**

1. **Function definition**: The code defines a function called `filter_even_numbers` that takes one argument, `numbers`, which is expected to be a list of numbers.
2. **List comprehension**: The function uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.
3. **Condition**: The condition used in the list comprehension is `num % 2 == 0`, which checks whether each number is even.

**What problem does this code solve?**

This code solves the problem of filtering out odd numbers from a list, leaving only the even numbers. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as data preprocessing or statistical analysis.

**How to use this code**

To use this code, simply call the `filter_even_numbers` function and pass your list of numbers as an argument:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```
Overall, this code demonstrates a concise and efficient way to filter out odd numbers from a list using Python's list comprehension feature.
