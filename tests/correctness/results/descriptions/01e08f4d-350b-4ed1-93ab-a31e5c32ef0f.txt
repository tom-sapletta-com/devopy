Let's break down this simple yet effective piece of code!

The code defines a function named `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. The purpose of this function is to add these two numbers together and return the result.

Here's what happens when you call the `add_numbers` function with two numbers:

1. The function receives the two input values (`a` and `b`) and stores them in memory.
2. The code inside the function (specifically, the line `return a + b`) performs the addition operation using the `+` operator.
3. The result of the addition is returned to the caller.

In other words, if you call `add_numbers(2, 3)`, the function will return `5`, which is the sum of `2` and `3`.

This code solves a very basic problem: adding two numbers together! You might be thinking, "Why would I need a separate function to do this?" Well, in larger programs, having functions like `add_numbers` can make your code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain. For example, you could use the same `add_numbers` function to add different types of values (e.g., integers, floats, or even strings).

Some benefits of using a dedicated function like this include:

* Reusability: You can call the `add_numbers` function multiple times with different inputs without having to rewrite the addition logic.
* Readability: The code is easy to understand because the intention is clear: add two numbers together and return the result.
* Flexibility: You could modify the `add_numbers` function in the future to handle more complex scenarios (e.g., adding multiple values or handling errors) without affecting the rest of your program.

Overall, this simple code demonstrates a fundamental concept in programming: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.
