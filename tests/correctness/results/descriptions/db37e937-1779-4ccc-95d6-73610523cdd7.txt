Here is the description of the code:

**What does this code do?**

This code defines a simple function called `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

**How does it work?**

The `add_numbers` function has two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers or floating-point numbers. The function uses the `+` operator to add these two numbers together, and then returns the result using the `return` statement.

In other words, if you call this function with two numbers, say 3 and 4, it will calculate the sum (7) and return that value.

**What problems does this code solve?**

This code solves a very basic problem: adding two numbers together. This might seem trivial, but in real-world applications, you often need to perform simple arithmetic operations like this, especially when working with data or performing calculations.

**How can I use this code?**

You can use this code as a building block for more complex programs. For example, you could use it to calculate the total cost of items in a shopping cart by adding up their prices. Or, you could use it to calculate the average score on a test by adding up individual scores.

Overall, this code demonstrates the basic concept of a function in Python: taking input, performing some calculation, and returning output. It's a simple but useful example that can be applied to many different situations!
