Here's a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `divide_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numbers. The function is designed to divide the first number (`a`) by the second number (`b`). However, it also includes error handling to prevent division by zero, which would otherwise raise an error.

**How does the code work?**

The code starts with a simple function definition: `def divide_numbers(a, b):`. This defines a new function named `divide_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`.

 Inside the function, there's a `try` block that attempts to perform the division operation: `return a / b`. This is equivalent to writing `result = a / b; return result`.

The `try` block is used to catch any exceptions that might occur during the execution of the code within it. In this case, the exception we're interested in is `ZeroDivisionError`, which would be raised if `b` is zero (i.e., you're trying to divide by zero).

**What happens when division by zero occurs?**

If `b` is zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is caught by the `except` block: `except ZeroDivisionError:`. In this case, instead of raising an error, the function returns a string saying "Nie można dzielić przez zero", which translates to "You can't divide by zero".

**Why do we need this code?**

In many real-world scenarios, you might need to perform division operations on data, and it's crucial to handle errors correctly. In this specific example, the function helps prevent unexpected errors from occurring when dividing numbers.

By using `try`-`except` blocks, the code ensures that your program remains stable and doesn't crash unexpectedly. This is especially important in applications where errors can lead to catastrophic consequences or compromise data integrity.

In summary, this Python code defines a simple division function with error handling for division by zero. It's designed to prevent unexpected errors and ensure that your program remains stable and reliable.
