Here's a detailed description of the given Python code:

**Code Description:**

The provided code is a function named `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**Function Explanation:**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list with only the even numbers. Here's how it works:

1. The function iterates over each number (`num`) in the input list `numbers`.
2. For each number, it checks if the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is equal to 0 using the modulo operator (`%`). This is a common way to check if a number is even.
3. If the number is even (i.e., the remainder is 0), it includes that number in the new list.
4. The function returns the resulting list of only the even numbers.

**How it Works:**

Let's say you call the function with the following input list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. Here's what would happen:

* The function iterates over each number in the list:
	+ `num` = 1: remainder of dividing by 2 is 1, so this number is not included.
	+ `num` = 2: remainder of dividing by 2 is 0, so this even number is included.
	+ `num` = 3: remainder of dividing by 2 is 1, so this number is not included.
	+ `num` = 4: remainder of dividing by 2 is 0, so this even number is included.
	+ `num` = 5: remainder of dividing by 2 is 1, so this number is not included.
	+ `num` = 6: remainder of dividing by 2 is 0, so this even number is included.
* The function returns the resulting list: `[2, 4, 6]`, which contains only the even numbers from the original list.

**Problem it Solves:**

This code helps solve the problem of filtering out odd numbers from a list of integers. It's useful in various situations, such as:

* Preprocessing data to remove noise or outliers
* Selecting specific types of data for further analysis
* Creating a subset of data that meets certain criteria

Overall, this code demonstrates a simple yet powerful technique for working with lists and filtering out specific values in Python.
