Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**Function:** `divide_numbers(a, b)`

**Purpose:** This function takes two numbers as input and returns their division result. It also handles the situation where the second number is zero, which would normally raise a ZeroDivisionError.

**How it works:**

1. The function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numeric values (e.g., integers or floats).
2. Inside the function, there's a `try` block that attempts to divide `a` by `b`. This is done using the standard division operator `/`.
3. If the division operation is successful, the result is returned.
4. However, if the second number (`b`) is zero, this would normally raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which would terminate the program.
5. To handle this situation, the function includes an `except` block that catches the `ZeroDivisionError`.
6. In the `except` block, instead of returning the division result (which wouldn't be meaningful in this case), the function returns a string indicating that dividing by zero is not possible.

**What the code does:**

This code provides a safe way to divide two numbers while preventing unexpected errors when the second number is zero. It's a simple yet important functionality, especially when working with numerical data or scientific computations.

**Problems solved:**

1. **Division by zero:** By catching the `ZeroDivisionError`, this code prevents the program from crashing or terminating unexpectedly.
2. **Invalid operation:** The function returns an informative message when division by zero is attempted, which can help users understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

**In summary:**

This Python code defines a simple yet useful function for dividing two numbers while handling the edge case of dividing by zero. It's a straightforward example of error handling in programming, making it a great learning tool for developers and non-developers alike!
