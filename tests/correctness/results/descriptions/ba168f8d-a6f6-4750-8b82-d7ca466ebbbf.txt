Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**Function:** `divide_numbers(a, b)`

**Purpose:** This function takes two numbers as input and divides them. It also handles the case where the second number is zero (i.e., division by zero), which would normally raise an error.

**How it works:**

1. The function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numerical values.
2. The function attempts to divide `a` by `b` using the `/` operator. This operation is wrapped in a `try` block.
3. If the division is successful, the result is returned as a numeric value.
4. However, if the second number (`b`) is zero, the division would normally raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. To handle this case, an `except` block is used to catch this error and return a meaningful message instead.

**What it does:**

This function provides a simple way to divide two numbers, while also handling the common scenario where someone tries to divide by zero. By returning a clear error message in this case, the function helps prevent unexpected errors or crashes.

**Solved problems:**

1. **Division by zero:** The function prevents division by zero, which would normally cause an error.
2. **Clear error messaging:** Instead of raising an error, the function returns a human-readable message that indicates what went wrong.

**How it works internally:**

Under the hood, the `try`-`except` block is used to catch and handle the `ZeroDivisionError`. When the division operation attempts to divide by zero, Python raises this error. The `except` block catches this error and executes the code inside it, returning a custom message instead of raising an error.

In summary, this function provides a safe way to divide two numbers while handling the common scenario where someone tries to divide by zero. It's a useful tool for any situation where division is required!
