Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

**What does this code do?**

This code defines a function called `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, as input. The function is designed to divide `a` by `b`, but with an important twist: it handles the case where `b` is zero.

**How does it work?**

The function is implemented using a `try-except` block, which allows us to catch and handle any exceptions that might occur during execution. In this case, we're catching a specific type of exception called `ZeroDivisionError`, which is raised when you try to divide a number by zero.

Here's what happens when the code runs:

1. The function receives two input values, `a` and `b`.
2. The code inside the `try` block attempts to divide `a` by `b`. If `b` is non-zero, this will succeed, and the result of the division will be returned.
3. However, if `b` is zero, the division operation raises a `ZeroDivisionError`, which is caught by the `except` block.
4. In the `except` block, we return a string indicating that it's not possible to divide by zero.

**What problems does this code solve?**

This code solves two main problems:

1. **Handling division by zero**: By catching and handling the `ZeroDivisionError`, we can prevent the program from crashing or producing unexpected results when trying to divide by zero.
2. **Returning meaningful error messages**: Instead of simply raising an exception, our code returns a helpful error message that informs the user about what went wrong.

**Why is this code useful?**

This code is useful in situations where you need to perform division operations with numbers, and you want to ensure that your program behaves correctly when faced with invalid input (like dividing by zero). This code can be used in a variety of contexts, such as scientific computing, data analysis, or even simple calculator programs.

Overall, this code demonstrates good programming practices, including error handling and clear documentation through comments.
