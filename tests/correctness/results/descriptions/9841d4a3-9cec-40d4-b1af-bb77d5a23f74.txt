Here is a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**Function:** `filter_even_numbers(numbers)`

**Description:** This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**How it works:**

1. The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list.
2. It iterates through each number (`num`) in the input list (`numbers`).
3. For each number, it checks if the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is equal to 0 using the modulo operator (`%`). In other words, it checks if the number is even (i.e., divisible by 2).
4. If the number is even, it adds it to the new list.
5. The function returns the resulting list containing only the even numbers.

**Example usage:**

Suppose you have a list of numbers `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. If you call the function like this: `result = filter_even_numbers(numbers)`, the output would be `[2, 4, 6]`.

**What problem does it solve?**

This function solves the problem of filtering out non-even numbers from a list. It's a simple but useful operation that can be applied to various types of data.

**How does it help?**

By using this function, you can quickly and easily extract only the even numbers from a larger dataset, which can be helpful in various applications such as:

* Data analysis: You may want to analyze only the even numbers in a dataset.
* Filtering out noise: Even numbers might represent meaningful data points, while odd numbers could be considered noise.
* Simplifying data: By removing non-even numbers, you can simplify your data and make it easier to work with.

Overall, this function is a useful tool for anyone working with lists of numbers in Python.
