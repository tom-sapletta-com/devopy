Here is the detailed description of the provided Python code:

**Code:** `add_numbers(a, b)`

**What it does:** This code defines a function called `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

**How it works:** The function has two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be integers or floating-point numbers. When the function is called with two numbers, it adds them together using the `+` operator and returns the result.

**Example usage:**

* If you call the function like this: `add_numbers(2, 3)`, it will return the sum of 2 and 3, which is 5.
* If you call the function with negative numbers, like this: `add_numbers(-1, -2)`, it will also return the sum, which is -3 in this case.

**Benefits:** This code solves a simple but common problem: adding two numbers together. It provides a reusable and efficient way to perform this operation without having to write a custom implementation each time you need to add two numbers.

**How it helps:** By providing a function for adding numbers, this code makes your Python program more modular and easier to maintain. You can use this function in various parts of your program without worrying about implementing the addition logic yourself.

In summary, this code defines a simple but useful function that adds two numbers together and returns the result. It's a great example of how you can write concise and effective Python code to solve everyday programming problems!
