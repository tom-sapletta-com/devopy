Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**Code Description**

The given code is a Python function named `filter_even_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

**Function Explanation**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list with only the even numbers. The syntax `[num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]` is equivalent to:

1. Iterate over each number (`num`) in the input list `numbers`.
2. Check if the current number is even by using the modulo operator `%`. If the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is 0, it means the number is even.
3. Include only the even numbers in a new list.

**How the Code Works**

Here's an example to illustrate how the code works:

Suppose you have a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. When you call the `filter_even_numbers` function with this list as input, it will return a new list containing only the even numbers: `[2, 4, 6]`.

**What the Code Does**

The code solves the problem of filtering out odd numbers from a list. It's useful when you need to process or analyze data that contains both odd and even values, but you're only interested in working with the even ones.

**Challenges Solved**

This code addresses the following challenges:

* How to efficiently filter out odd numbers from a list.
* How to create a new list containing only the desired elements (even numbers) without modifying the original list.

**Conclusion**

In summary, the `filter_even_numbers` function is a simple yet powerful tool for filtering even numbers from a list. It's a great example of how Python's concise syntax and built-in functions can help you solve common problems in data processing and analysis.
