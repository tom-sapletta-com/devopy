Here's a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a simple function named `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as input, adds them together, and returns the result.

**How does it work?**

When you call the `add_numbers` function with two arguments (let's say `a` and `b`), Python will execute the following steps:

1. The function receives the values of `a` and `b`.
2. The code inside the function, which is simply `return a + b`, is executed.
3. The addition operation (`a + b`) is performed, and the result is calculated.
4. The result is returned to the caller using the `return` statement.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves the problem of adding two numbers together in a simple and straightforward way. It provides a reusable piece of code that can be used multiple times with different input values, making it a great example of modular programming.

**How is it useful?**

This code is useful whenever you need to add two numbers together in your Python program. For instance:

* You're working on a simple calculator and want to add two numbers entered by the user.
* You're tracking the sum of two values over time (e.g., a running total).
* You're creating a game where players earn points, and you need to add their scores together.

**In conclusion**

The `add_numbers` function is a basic but useful piece of code that demonstrates how to define and use a simple function in Python. It's a great starting point for learning more about programming concepts like modularization, functions, and variables.
