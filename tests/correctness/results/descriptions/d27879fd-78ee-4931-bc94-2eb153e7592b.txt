Here is a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**Code:** `filter_even_numbers(numbers)`

**What does it do?**

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list that only contains the even numbers from the original list.

**How does it work?**

The function uses a technique called "list comprehension" to create a new list. List comprehension is a concise way to create lists by iterating over an iterable (like a list) and applying a condition or transformation to each item.

In this case, the function iterates over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`. For each number, it checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is 0 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), then the number is even.

If a number is even, it gets included in the new list. The `return` statement simply returns this new list of even numbers.

**Example usage:**

Suppose we have the following input list:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
If we call the function with this input, it would return a new list containing only the even numbers:
```python
even_numbers = filter_even_numbers(numbers)
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```
**Benefits and uses:**

This function is useful when you need to extract or manipulate a subset of data from a larger dataset. In this case, it helps you isolate the even numbers in a list, which can be useful in various applications such as:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Statistical analysis and visualization
* Machine learning model development

The function also demonstrates good coding practices, such as:

* Using descriptive variable names (e.g., `numbers` instead of `lst`)
* Including a clear docstring that explains the function's purpose and behavior
* Using list comprehension for concise and readable code
