Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, as input. The main purpose of this function is to divide `a` by `b`. However, it also handles a common error scenario where `b` is zero (i.e., trying to divide by zero).

**How does the code work?**

The function consists of two parts: a try block and an except block.

1. **Try block**: The try block attempts to execute the division operation `a / b`. This is done using the `return` statement, which returns the result of the division.
2. **Except block**: If the division operation fails (i.e., if `b` is zero), the code catches a `ZeroDivisionError` exception and executes the code inside the except block.

**What problems does the code solve?**

This code solves two main issues:

1. **Handling division by zero errors**: When you try to divide by zero, Python raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. This code catches this error and returns a friendly message instead of crashing.
2. **Returning meaningful results**: By returning a string "Nie można dzielić przez zero" (which means "Cannot divide by zero" in Polish), the function provides a clear indication that division is not possible.

**Key takeaways**

* The `divide_numbers` function takes two numbers as input and attempts to divide them.
* It handles division by zero errors by catching the exception and returning an error message instead of crashing.
* This code demonstrates good programming practices, such as handling errors and providing meaningful results in case of failure.
