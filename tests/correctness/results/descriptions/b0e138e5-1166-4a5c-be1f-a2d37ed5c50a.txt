I'd be happy to help you understand the code!

**What does this code do?**

This code defines a simple function called `add_numbers` that takes two numbers, adds them together, and returns the result.

**How does it work?**

The `add_numbers` function has two parameters: `a` and `b`. These are the two numbers you want to add. The function uses the plus operator (`+`) to combine these numbers and returns the resulting sum.

In other words, if you call the function with two arguments, like `add_numbers(2, 3)`, it will return `5`, which is the result of adding 2 and 3 together.

**What problems does this code solve?**

This code solves a very basic problem: adding two numbers together. You might use this function in a program that needs to perform arithmetic operations, such as calculating totals or averaging values.

**How can I use this code?**

To use this code, you would need to define the `add_numbers` function and then call it with the numbers you want to add. For example:

```python
result = add_numbers(2, 3)
print(result)  # prints 5
```

This code is simple, but it demonstrates some important concepts in Python programming, such as:

* Defining a function that takes arguments and returns a value
* Using the plus operator (`+`) to perform arithmetic operations
* Calling a function with specific values

Overall, this code is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn more about Python programming!
