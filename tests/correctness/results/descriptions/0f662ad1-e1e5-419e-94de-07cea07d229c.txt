I'd be happy to help you understand this code!

The provided code is written in Python and defines a function called `add_numbers`. This function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numbers (e.g., integers or floats).

The main purpose of the `add_numbers` function is to add these two input numbers together and return the result.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. The first line, `def add_numbers(a, b):`, defines the function. The keyword `def` indicates that we're defining a new function, and `add_numbers` is the name given to this function. The parentheses contain the arguments that the function will accept, in this case, `a` and `b`.
2. The docstring, `"Dodaje dwie liczby i zwraca wynik."`, provides a brief description of what the function does. In English, this would translate to "Adds two numbers and returns the result."
3. The final line, `return a + b`, is where the magic happens! This line adds the values of `a` and `b` together using the `+` operator and returns the resulting value.

In simple terms, when you call the `add_numbers` function with two numbers as arguments, it will add those numbers and give you the result. For example:

```python
result = add_numbers(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

This code is useful for performing basic arithmetic operations, like adding two numbers together. It's a fundamental building block in many programming tasks!

As for problems it solves, this function helps simplify the process of adding two numbers together, making your code more concise and easier to read. You can use it in various contexts, such as:

* Calculating totals or sums
* Performing simple arithmetic operations
* Creating mathematical models or simulations

In summary, the `add_numbers` function is a straightforward way to add two numbers together and return the result. It's an essential piece of code that helps you perform basic arithmetic operations in your Python programs!
