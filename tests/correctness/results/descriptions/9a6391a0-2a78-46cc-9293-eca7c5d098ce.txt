Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

**What is this code?**
This code defines a simple function in Python that adds two numbers together and returns the result.

**The Function: `add_numbers(a, b)`**

The code defines a single function called `add_numbers` that takes two parameters: `a` and `b`. These are expected to be numerical values (e.g., integers or floats).

**How it works**
When you call this function with two numbers as arguments, it will perform the following steps:

1. It will add the two numbers together using the `+` operator.
2. It will return the result of the addition.

**What does it do?**
In essence, this code solves a simple mathematical problem: adding two numbers together. This might seem trivial, but functions like this are building blocks for more complex programs. You can use this function to add any two numerical values in your Python program.

**Example usage**

You could call this function with two numbers, like this:
```python
result = add_numbers(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```
In this example, the `add_numbers` function is called with arguments `a=2` and `b=3`. The function adds these two numbers together (i.e., 2 + 3 = 5), and returns the result. You can then print or use the result as needed in your program.

**Why is this useful?**
This simple function demonstrates several important concepts:

1. **Modularity**: This code is modular, meaning it performs a specific task without affecting other parts of your program.
2. **Reusability**: You can reuse this function in different parts of your program or even in multiple programs.
3. **Flexibility**: The function is designed to work with various types of numerical values (e.g., integers, floats).

Overall, this code shows how a simple function can be used to perform a basic mathematical operation and highlights the importance of modularity, reusability, and flexibility in programming.
