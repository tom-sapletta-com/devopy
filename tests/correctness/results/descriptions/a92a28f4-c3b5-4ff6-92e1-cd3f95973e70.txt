Here is the detailed description of the Python code:

**Function Name:** `divide_numbers`
**Purpose:** To divide two numbers and handle the case where division by zero occurs.

**Code Analysis:**

The function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numeric values. The function's main purpose is to perform a simple division operation between these two numbers. However, it also includes error handling to prevent unexpected behavior when dividing by zero.

Here's how the code works:

1. **Try-Except Block:** The code uses a try-except block to catch any potential errors that might occur during the execution of the function.
2. **Division Operation:** Inside the try block, the code performs the division operation using the `/` operator. This will return the result of the division if both `a` and `b` are non-zero.
3. **ZeroDivisionError Handling:** If a ZeroDivisionError occurs (i.e., when `b` is zero), the except block is executed. In this case, the function returns a string "Nie można dzielić przez zero", which translates to "Cannot divide by zero" in Polish.

**What the Code Does:**

The code provides a basic arithmetic operation for dividing two numbers. However, it also addresses a common problem that can occur when performing division operations – namely, attempting to divide by zero.

When you call this function with valid input (i.e., non-zero values for both `a` and `b`), it will perform the expected division operation. If, however, you try to divide by zero (e.g., `divide_numbers(10, 0)`), the code will catch the error and return a meaningful message instead of attempting an invalid operation.

**Problems Solved:**

The code solves two main problems:

1. **Division by Zero:** By catching and handling the ZeroDivisionError, the code prevents potential errors or crashes that might occur when attempting to divide by zero.
2. **Clear Error Messages:** The function returns a clear error message when division by zero occurs, making it easier for users or developers to identify and address issues.

**How It Works:**

The code works by using a try-except block to catch any potential errors during the execution of the division operation. If an error occurs (i.e., when `b` is zero), the except block is executed, and the function returns a string indicating that division by zero is not possible.

In summary, this Python code provides a basic arithmetic operation for dividing two numbers while also addressing the common problem of attempting to divide by zero.
