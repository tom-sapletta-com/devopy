Here's a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a single function called `execute()` that calculates and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100. In other words, it adds up all the integers from 1 to 100 and displays the result.

**How does the code work?**

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The first line, `total = sum(range(1, 101))`, calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100 using a built-in Python function called `sum()`. The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at 100 (exclusive).
2. The `sum()` function takes this sequence as input and returns the total sum of all the numbers in the range.
3. The result is assigned to a variable named `total`.
4. The final line, `return f"Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: {total}"`, returns a string that displays the calculated sum along with a message.

**Key concepts explained**

* **Functions**: In Python, a function is a block of code that can be executed multiple times from different parts of your program. The `execute()` function in this code calculates and returns the desired sum.
* **Built-in functions**: Python provides many built-in functions that you can use in your code. In this case, we're using the `sum()` and `range()` functions to perform calculations.
* **Variable assignment**: We assign the result of the calculation to a variable named `total`, which is then used in the final output string.

**What problems does the code solve?**

This code solves the problem of calculating the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100. This might be useful in various scenarios, such as:
* Calculating the total value of a sequence of numbers.
* Verifying the correctness of a mathematical formula or algorithm.
* Creating a simple program that generates output based on some calculation.

Overall, this code demonstrates basic Python concepts, including functions, built-in functions, and variable assignment. It also shows how to calculate and display a result using these concepts.
