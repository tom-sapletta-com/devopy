Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**What the code does:**

The code defines a function called `execute` that returns the current date and time in a specific format.

**How it works:**

1. The first line, `import datetime`, imports the `datetime` module, which provides classes for manipulating dates and times.
2. The next line, `now = datetime.datetime.now()`, creates a new `datetime` object representing the current date and time using the `now()` method of the `datetime` class.
3. The third line, `return f"Aktualna data i czas: {now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")`, returns a string that contains the current date and time in a specific format.

**What it does with the date and time:**

The code uses the `strftime` method of the `datetime` object to format the current date and time into a string. The format string `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` tells Python to include:

* `%Y`: The four-digit year
* `%m`: The two-digit month (01-12)
* `%d`: The two-digit day of the month (01-31)
* `%H`: The two-digit hour of the day (00-23)
* `%M`: The two-digit minute of the hour (00-59)
* `%S`: The two-digit second of the minute (00-59)

The resulting string is then returned by the `execute` function.

**What problem does it solve:**

This code solves the problem of easily obtaining and displaying the current date and time in a specific format. This can be useful in various situations, such as:

* Logging events or errors
* Tracking progress or milestones
* Displaying system information

Overall, this code is a simple but effective way to get the current date and time in Python.
