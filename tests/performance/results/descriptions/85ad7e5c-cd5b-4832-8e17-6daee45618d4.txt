I'd be happy to explain this Python code in simple terms.

**What the code does**

This code defines a single function called `execute`. When you run this function, it will return the current date and time as a string.

**How the code works**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens when you execute this code:

1. The first line, `def execute():`, defines a new function called `execute`. This is like setting up a recipe for your computer to follow.
2. The next line, `import datetime`, imports a built-in Python module called `datetime`. Think of modules as libraries that provide pre-built functions and tools. In this case, the `datetime` module helps us work with dates and times.
3. The line `now = datetime.datetime.now()` uses the `datetime` module to get the current date and time. The `now` variable is set to a datetime object that represents the current moment.
4. Finally, the line `return f"Aktualna data i czas: {now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}"` takes the `now` object and formats it into a string using a special syntax called f-strings (introduced in Python 3.6). The resulting string is a human-readable representation of the current date and time, like "2022-07-25 14:30:45".

**What problems does this code solve?**

This code provides a simple way to get the current date and time, which can be useful in various situations, such as:

* Logging events or recording timestamps
* Displaying the current time on a user interface
* Generating reports with accurate dates and times

**In summary**

This Python code defines a function called `execute` that returns the current date and time as a string. It imports the `datetime` module to get the current moment, formats it into a human-readable string using f-strings, and returns the result.
