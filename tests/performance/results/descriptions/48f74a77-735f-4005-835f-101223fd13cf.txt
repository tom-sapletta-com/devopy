Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a single function called `execute`, which calculates and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100. In other words, it adds up all the integers from 1 to 100 and displays the result.

**How does it work?**

To achieve this, the code uses two main Python features:

1. **The `sum` function**: This built-in Python function takes an iterable (like a list or range) as input and returns the sum of its elements.
2. **The `range` function**: This function generates a sequence of numbers starting from the first argument (`1`) up to, but not including, the second argument (`101`). In this case, it creates a range of numbers from 1 to 100.

Here's what happens when you run the code:

1. The `execute` function is called.
2. The `range(1, 101)` expression generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100.
3. The `sum` function takes this range as input and calculates the sum of all these numbers.
4. The result (the sum) is assigned to the variable `total`.
5. Finally, the code uses an f-string (a new way of formatting strings in Python) to create a string that displays the result. This string includes the phrase "Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi:", followed by the value of `total`.

**What problems does this code solve?**

This code is quite simple, but it demonstrates some useful concepts:

* It shows how to use the `sum` and `range` functions to perform a common mathematical operation (calculating the sum of a sequence of numbers).
* It introduces the concept of a function, which encapsulates a specific piece of code that can be called multiple times with different inputs.
* It uses f-strings to format a string in a concise way.

Overall, this code is a good example of how Python's built-in functions and features can be used to solve simple yet useful problems.
