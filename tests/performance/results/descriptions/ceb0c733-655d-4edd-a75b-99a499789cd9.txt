Here is a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a single function called `execute()` that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 and returns a string with the result.

**How does it work?**

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The first line, `total = sum(range(1, 101))`, uses a built-in Python function called `sum()` to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.
	* `range(1, 101)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
	* The `sum()` function adds up all these numbers and stores the result in the variable `total`.
2. The second line, `return f"Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: {total}"`, returns a string that displays the calculated sum.
	* The `f` prefix before the string indicates that it's a formatted string literal (also known as an f-string).
	* `{total}` is a placeholder that will be replaced with the actual value of the `total` variable.

**What problems does the code solve?**

This code solves the problem of calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 in a simple and efficient way. It's a useful example of how Python's built-in functions (like `sum()` and `range()`) can be used to perform calculations with ease.

**How is the code structured?**

The code consists of a single function, `execute()`, which has two main parts:

1. The calculation part: `total = sum(range(1, 101))`.
2. The output part: `return f"Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: {total}"`.

This structure is typical for Python functions that need to perform some calculation and then return a result.

Overall, this code is a great example of how Python's syntax and built-in functions can be used to solve a simple yet useful problem in a concise and efficient way.
