Here's a detailed description of the code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `execute()` that calculates and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.

**How does it work?**

 Inside the `execute()` function, there are two main steps:

1. **Calculating the sum**: The `range(1, 101)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive). The `sum()` function then adds up all these numbers to get the total sum.
2. **Returning the result**: The calculated sum is assigned to a variable called `total`. Finally, the code uses an f-string (a new way of formatting strings in Python) to create a string that says "Sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: [insert sum here]". This string is then returned by the function.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves the problem of calculating and displaying the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100. This might be useful in various situations, such as:

* Calculating the total value of a set of items
* Computing the average score or grade
* Creating a simple arithmetic exercise or quiz

**How does it work behind the scenes?**

Here's what's happening under the hood:

* The `range(1, 101)` function generates an iterator that produces the numbers from 1 to 100. This is more memory-efficient than creating a list of all these numbers.
* The `sum()` function adds up all the numbers in the sequence, using a simple iterative algorithm.
* The f-string uses a feature called "formatted strings" (introduced in Python 3.6) to insert the calculated sum into the string.

Overall, this code is a straightforward example of how to perform a calculation and display the result in Python.
