Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**Code Overview**
The code defines a single function called `execute` which returns the current date and time in a specific format.

**Function Breakdown**

1. `import datetime`: This line imports the `datetime` module, which provides classes for manipulating dates and times.
2. `now = datetime.datetime.now()`: This line creates a new `datetime` object representing the current date and time using the `now()` method from the `datetime` class.
3. `return f"Aktualna data i czas: {now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}"`: This line returns a string containing the current date and time in a specific format.

**Format String Explanation**
The returned string is formatted using an f-string (a new-style string formatting method introduced in Python 3.6). The format string `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"` specifies the desired output format:

* `%Y` represents the four-digit year
* `%m` represents the two-digit month (01-12)
* `%d` represents the two-digit day of the month (01-31)
* `%H` represents the 24-hour clock hour (00-23)
* `%M` represents the minute (00-59)
* `%S` represents the second (00-59)

**What the Code Does**
When called, the `execute` function returns a string containing the current date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".

**Problems Solved**
This code solves the problem of easily obtaining and displaying the current date and time in a specific format.

**How it Works**

1. The function is called, which triggers the execution of its contents.
2. The `datetime` module is imported to access its classes for working with dates and times.
3. The current date and time are obtained using the `now()` method from the `datetime` class.
4. The returned string contains the current date and time in the specified format, which is formatted using an f-string.

Overall, this code provides a simple way to get and display the current date and time in a specific format, making it useful for various applications such as logging or displaying system information.
