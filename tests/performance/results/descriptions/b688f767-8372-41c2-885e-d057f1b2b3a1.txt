Here is a detailed description of the provided Python code:

**Function:** `execute()`

The `execute()` function is designed to calculate and display the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

**Code Analysis:**

1. The first line, `total = sum(range(1, 101))`, calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using the built-in Python `sum()` function.
	* `range(1, 101)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
	* `sum()` takes this range and returns the total sum of these numbers.
2. The `return` statement is used to output a formatted string that includes the calculated sum.
	* The string uses an f-string formatting (`f""`) to insert the value of `total` into the output string.

**How it works:**

When you call the `execute()` function, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 and returns a string with this result. For example, if you run the code, you'll get an output like:

```
Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: 5050
```

**What problem does it solve?**

This code solves a simple mathematical calculation task: calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 100. This might be useful in various situations, such as:

* Demonstrating basic arithmetic operations in Python.
* Calculating sums for educational purposes or data analysis.
* Creating simple scripts that perform calculations based on user input.

**How does it work?**

The code works by using the `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100, and then passing this range to the `sum()` function. This calculates the total sum of these numbers. The result is then formatted into a string and returned by the `execute()` function.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
