Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

**What the code does**

The code defines a single function called `execute` that returns the current date and time in a specific format. When you run this code, it will give you the exact moment when the execution started.

**How it works**

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The first line, `def execute():`, defines a new function named `execute`. This is where the magic happens!
2. The next line, `import datetime`, imports the `datetime` module from Python's standard library. This module provides classes for manipulating dates and times.
3. The line `now = datetime.datetime.now()` creates an object called `now` that represents the current date and time. Think of it like a snapshot of the moment when you ran this code!
4. Finally, the line `return f"Aktualna data i czas: {now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}"` returns a string that includes the current date and time in a human-readable format.

**What the return statement does**

The return statement uses Python's new f-strings (introduced in Python 3.6) to create a formatted string. The `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` part is a format code that tells `strftime()` how to represent the date and time.

Here's what each part of the format code means:

* `%Y`: Four-digit year
* `%m`: Two-digit month (01-12)
* `%d`: Two-digit day (1-31)
* `%H`: Two-digit hour in 24-hour format (00-23)
* `%M`: Two-digit minute (0-59)
* `%S`: Two-digit second (0-59)

When you run this code, it will return a string like "Aktualna data i czas: 2023-07-25 14:30:45", which represents the exact moment when you executed the code.

**What problems does the code solve?**

This code solves the problem of needing to get the current date and time in a specific format. It's useful for logging, tracking, or reporting purposes.

In summary, this code defines a function `execute` that returns the current date and time in a human-readable format using Python's `datetime` module.
