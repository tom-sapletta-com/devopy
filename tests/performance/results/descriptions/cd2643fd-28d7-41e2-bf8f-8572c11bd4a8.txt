Here's a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `execute` that calculates and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.

**How does it work?**

To understand how this works, let's break down the code step by step:

1. The first line, `def execute():`, defines the `execute` function. This function takes no arguments (i.e., it doesn't require any input).
2. Inside the function, there is a comment that explains what the code does: "Obliczanie sumy liczb od 1 do 100". In English, this translates to "Calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 100".
3. The line `total = sum(range(1, 101))` uses Python's built-in `sum` function and `range` function to calculate the sum.
	* `range(1, 101)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive). This is like saying "give me all the numbers from 1 up to but not including 101".
	* The `sum` function then adds up all these numbers and returns the total.
	* We assign this total sum to a variable called `total`.
4. Finally, the code uses Python's f-string formatting (introduced in Python 3.6) to create a string that says "Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: {total}" (which translates to "The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: ..."). The `{total}` part is replaced with the actual value of `total`.
5. The code then returns this formatted string, so when you call the `execute` function, it will print out a message like "Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: 5050" (which translates to "The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: 5050").

**What problems does the code solve?**

This code solves the problem of calculating the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100. This might be useful in various situations, such as:

* Calculating the total value of a set of items (e.g., prices or quantities).
* Generating statistical data.
* Demonstrating basic mathematical operations.

**How does it work under the hood?**

When you run this code, Python's interpreter executes the following steps:

1. It parses the code and creates an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the function.
2. The AST is then executed by the interpreter, which performs the necessary calculations to evaluate the `range` and `sum` functions.
3. The result of the calculation (i.e., the total sum) is assigned to the `total` variable.
4. Finally, the formatted string is created using f-string formatting, and the `execute` function returns this string.

Overall, this code demonstrates basic Python syntax and functionality, including functions, variables, and data structures like sequences (in this case, a range of numbers).
