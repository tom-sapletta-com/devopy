Here's a detailed explanation of the given Python code:

**What the code does**

The code defines a single function called `execute()` that calculates and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100. When executed, this function prints out a message stating the total sum.

**How it works**

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The first line, `def execute():`, defines a new function named `execute()`. This is a common convention in Python, where functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the name of the function.
2. Inside the `execute()` function, we have a single statement: `total = sum(range(1, 101))`. Here's what happens:
	* `range(1, 101)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive). This is done using Python's built-in `range()` function, which takes two arguments: the starting value and the ending value.
	* `sum()` calculates the sum of all numbers in the generated sequence. In this case, it adds up all the numbers from 1 to 100.
	* The result is assigned to a variable named `total`.
3. Finally, we have a return statement: `return f"Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: {total}"`. Here's what happens:
	* The `f` string prefix indicates that this is a formatted string literal (also known as an f-string). This allows us to embed expressions directly into the string using curly braces (`{}`).
	* Inside the string, we have two placeholders:
		+ `"Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: "` is the text to be printed.
		+ `{total}` is the value of the `total` variable, which was calculated earlier. When the code runs, this placeholder will be replaced with the actual value.

**What problems does it solve**

This code solves a simple mathematical problem by calculating and printing the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100. This could be useful in various contexts, such as:

* Educating students about basic arithmetic operations
* Demonstrating how to use Python's built-in functions (like `range()` and `sum()`)
* Creating a quick calculator for simple calculations

**How it works under the hood**

From a technical perspective, here are some interesting details:

* The `range(1, 101)` expression creates an iterator object that generates numbers from 1 to 100. This is more memory-efficient than creating a list of all those numbers.
* The `sum()` function uses this iterator to calculate the sum of the numbers in the sequence. It does this by iterating over the numbers and adding them up internally.

Overall, this code demonstrates some basic concepts in Python programming, such as defining functions, using built-in functions (like `range()` and `sum()`), and working with strings.
