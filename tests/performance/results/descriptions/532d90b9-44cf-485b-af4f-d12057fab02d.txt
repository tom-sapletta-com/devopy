Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `execute()` that returns the current date and time in a specific format.

**How does it work?**

When you call the `execute()` function, it performs the following steps:

1. It imports the `datetime` module, which is a built-in Python library for working with dates and times.
2. It uses the `now()` method from the `datetime` module to get the current date and time as a `datetime.datetime` object.
3. It assigns this `datetime` object to a variable called `now`.
4. It uses the `strftime()` method on the `now` object to format the date and time in a specific way. The format string `'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` specifies that we want the year (four digits), month, day, hour, minute, and second.
5. Finally, it returns a string containing the formatted date and time using an f-string.

**What's the output?**

When you run the `execute()` function, it will return a string like this:

"Aktualna data i czas: 2023-07-25 14:30:00"

This is the current date and time in the format specified by the `strftime()` method.

**Why would someone use this code?**

This code is useful when you need to get the current date and time in a specific format, such as for logging purposes or displaying a timestamp. It's also a good example of how to work with dates and times in Python using the `datetime` module.

Overall, this code is simple but effective at achieving its goal.
