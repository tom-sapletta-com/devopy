I'd be happy to explain this code in simple terms!

The provided Python code is a function called `execute()` that returns the current date and time. Let me break it down for you:

**What the code does:**

When you call the `execute()` function, it will return a string containing the current date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".

**How it works:**

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what's happening inside the code:

1. **`import datetime`**: The code starts by importing the `datetime` module, which provides functionality for working with dates and times.
2. **`now = datetime.datetime.now()`**: The code uses the `datetime.datetime.now()` method to get the current date and time. This method returns a `datetime` object representing the current moment in time.
3. **`return f"Aktualna data i czas: {now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")`**: The code then uses an f-string (a new way of formatting strings in Python) to create a string that includes the current date and time.

The `{now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}` part is using the `strftime()` method to format the `datetime` object as a string. The format string `'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` specifies that the output should be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".

**What problems does this code solve?**

This code is useful for getting the current date and time in a specific format, which can be useful in various applications such as:

* Logging system events
* Generating timestamps for data records
* Displaying the current date and time to users

Overall, this code provides a simple way to get the current date and time in a human-readable format.
