Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `execute()` that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and returns a string with the result.

**How does it work?**

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `def execute():` - This line defines the `execute()` function, which is where the magic happens.
2. `total = sum(range(1, 101))` - Inside the function, we use a built-in Python function called `sum()` to calculate the total sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive). The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100, and the `sum()` function adds them up.
3. `return f"Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: {total}"` - Finally, we use an f-string (a new way of formatting strings in Python) to create a string that includes the result of the calculation. The string says "The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is: [insert result here]."

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves the problem of calculating the sum of a sequence of numbers, which is a common task in many areas of mathematics and programming.

**How does it work under the hood?**

Here's what's happening behind the scenes:

* The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 using an algorithm called "incremental arithmetic" (in simple terms, it starts with 1 and adds 1 each time until it reaches 100).
* The `sum()` function iterates over this sequence of numbers, adding each one up.
* The result is stored in the `total` variable.

**In summary**

This code defines a simple function called `execute()` that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and returns a string with the result. It uses built-in Python functions like `range()` and `sum()` to do its job, making it easy to understand and modify.
