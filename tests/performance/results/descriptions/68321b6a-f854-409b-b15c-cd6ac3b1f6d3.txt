Here's a detailed description of the Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `execute()` that calculates and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to 100. In other words, it adds up all the numbers from 1 to 100 and prints the result.

**How does it work?**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The `sum` function is used with the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive). This is done using the syntax `range(1, 101)`, which creates a range of numbers starting from 1 and ending at 100.
2. The `sum` function takes this sequence of numbers and adds them up, returning the total sum.
3. The `execute()` function returns a string that includes the calculated sum, using the f-string formatting (introduced in Python 3.6). The string has the format `"Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: {total}"`, where `{total}` is replaced with the actual sum value.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves a simple mathematical problem by providing a straightforward way to calculate the sum of consecutive integers. It's a useful example of how Python's built-in functions and syntax can be used to perform calculations efficiently.

**Key concepts:**

* The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers.
* The `sum` function is used to add up the elements in a sequence.
* F-strings are used for formatting strings with variables (in this case, the sum value).
* Functions can be defined and executed independently.

Overall, this code demonstrates basic Python syntax and data manipulation concepts, making it easy to understand and use.
