Here's a detailed description of the code:

**What does this code do?**

This Python code defines a function called `execute()` that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 and prints out the result.

**How does it work?**

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The first line, `def execute():`, defines the function `execute()`. This is a basic building block in Python programming.
2. Inside the `execute()` function, we have a comment that explains what the code is supposed to do: "Obliczanie sumy liczb od 1 do 100". This is just a note for someone reading the code, and it doesn't affect the execution of the program.
3. The next line, `total = sum(range(1, 101))`, calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using the built-in `sum()` function and the `range()` function.
	* `range(1, 101)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
	* `sum()` adds up all the numbers in that sequence and returns the result.
	* The result is stored in the variable `total`.
4. Finally, we have the line `return f"Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: {total}"`. This line uses a feature called "f-strings" (introduced in Python 3.6) to create a formatted string.
	* The `f` before the quotation marks tells Python that this is an f-string.
	* Inside the quotation marks, we have a simple sentence that includes the value of the `total` variable using curly braces `{}`.
	* The result of the calculation (i.e., the sum) is inserted into the string at the exact point where `{total}` appears.

**What problems does this code solve?**

This code solves the problem of calculating the sum of a range of numbers, which can be useful in various mathematical or statistical applications. It also demonstrates basic programming concepts such as functions, variable assignment, and formatted strings.

**How does it work under the hood?**

When you run this code, Python's interpreter executes the instructions one by one. Here's what happens:

1. The `execute()` function is called (e.g., when you type `print(execute())` in your Python shell).
2. The function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using the `range()` and `sum()` functions.
3. The result is stored in the `total` variable.
4. The formatted string is created using f-strings, which includes the value of the `total` variable.
5. The resulting string is returned by the `execute()` function.

Overall, this code is a simple example of how Python programming can be used to solve a specific problem (in this case, calculating a sum) in a clear and concise way.
