Here is a detailed explanation of the Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `execute` that returns the current date and time in a human-readable format.

**How does it work?**

The function starts by importing the `datetime` module, which provides classes for working with dates and times. The `now()` method is used to get the current date and time as a `datetime.datetime` object.

The code then assigns this object to a variable named `now`. This is equivalent to taking a snapshot of the current date and time.

Next, the code uses the `strftime()` method to format the `now` object in a specific way. The format string `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` tells Python to display the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, followed by the time in the format `HH:MM:SS`.

Finally, the code returns a string that combines the formatted date and time with the text "Aktualna data i czas" (which means "Current date and time" in Polish). This is equivalent to printing the current date and time to the console.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves the problem of getting the current date and time in a specific format, which can be useful for logging purposes or displaying system information. It's a simple but useful utility function that can be easily integrated into larger programs or scripts.

Overall, this code is a great example of how Python's built-in `datetime` module can be used to manipulate dates and times, making it easy to work with these essential data types in your applications.
