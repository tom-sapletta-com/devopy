I'd be happy to explain this code in simple terms!

This is a Python function called `execute` that returns the current date and time in a specific format. Here's what it does:

1. The function starts by importing the `datetime` module, which provides classes for working with dates and times.
2. It then uses the `now()` method to get the current date and time as a `datetime.datetime` object.
3. The code converts this object into a string using the `strftime` method. This method takes a format string as an argument, which specifies how the date and time should be formatted.

The format string used in this case is `'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`, which means:

* `%Y`: The four-digit year
* `%m`: The two-digit month (01-12)
* `%d`: The two-digit day of the month (01-31)
* `%H`: The hour in 24-hour format (00-23)
* `%M`: The minute (00-59)
* `%S`: The second (00-59)

So, when you call the `execute` function, it will return a string like this: "Aktualna data i czas: 2023-07-25 14:30:45"

This code solves a simple problem: getting the current date and time in a human-readable format. It's useful for logging events, tracking timestamps, or simply displaying the current time.

The function itself is quite straightforward, but it demonstrates some important Python concepts:

* Importing modules to access specific functionality
* Using classes and objects to represent dates and times
* Formatting strings using placeholders and templates

Overall, this code is a great example of how Python can be used for simple tasks that require working with dates and times.
