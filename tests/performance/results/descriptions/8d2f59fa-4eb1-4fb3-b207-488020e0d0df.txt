Here is a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a function called `execute()` that calculates and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100. Yes, you read that right - it's a simple program that adds up all the numbers from 1 to 100!

**How does it work?**

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The first line, `total = sum(range(1, 101))`, is where the magic happens. It uses the built-in `sum()` function and `range()` function to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.
	* `range(1, 101)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
	* The `sum()` function takes this sequence as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in that sequence.
2. The `return` statement at the end of the function uses an f-string (a new way of formatting strings in Python) to create a string that displays the calculated total.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code is incredibly simple, but it's actually quite useful! For example:

* If you need to quickly calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 for some reason (e.g., for a math problem or a programming challenge), this code can help you do just that.
* It's also a great way to introduce beginners to basic Python concepts, such as functions, variables, and built-in functions like `range()` and `sum()`.

**How does it work under the hood?**

When you run this code, here's what happens:

1. The Python interpreter reads through the code line by line.
2. When it reaches the `total = sum(range(1, 101))` line, it executes that statement.
3. The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 and stores them in memory.
4. The `sum()` function takes this sequence as input and calculates the sum by iterating through each number in the sequence, adding them up, and storing the result in memory.
5. Finally, when the `return` statement is executed, it uses the calculated total value to create a string that displays the result.

That's a basic overview of what this code does!
