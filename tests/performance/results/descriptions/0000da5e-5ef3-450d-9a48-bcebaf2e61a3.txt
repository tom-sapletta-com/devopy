Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python code:

**Code Name:** `execute`
**Functionality:** This code defines a function that returns the current date and time.

**What does it do?**

The code starts by defining a function called `execute`. Inside this function, there are three main steps:

1. **Importing a library:** The first line, `import datetime`, imports the `datetime` module from Python's standard library. This module provides functions for working with dates and times.
2. **Getting the current date and time:** The next line, `now = datetime.datetime.now()`, uses the `now()` method from the `datetime` module to get the current date and time. This returns a `datetime` object representing the current moment.
3. **Converting the date and time to a string:** The last part of the code, `return f"Aktualna data i czas: {now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")`, takes the current date and time (stored in the `now` variable) and converts it to a string using the `strftime()` method. This method formats the date and time according to the specified format (`'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`). The resulting string is then returned by the function.

**What problems does it solve?**

This code solves the problem of retrieving and displaying the current date and time in a human-readable format. It's useful for logging purposes, tracking changes, or simply displaying the current moment in an application.

**How does it work?**

When you call the `execute()` function, it executes the following steps:

1. Importing the `datetime` module.
2. Getting the current date and time using the `now()` method.
3. Converting the date and time to a string using the `strftime()` method.

The resulting string is then returned by the function, allowing you to use it in your code or display it to the user.
