Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

**What the code does:**
The code defines a single function called `execute()` that calculates and returns the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

**How it works:**

1. The first line, `total = sum(range(1, 101))`, uses a built-in Python function called `sum()` to calculate the sum of numbers in a given range.
2. The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at 100 (inclusive).
3. The `sum()` function takes this sequence as input and returns the total sum of all numbers in the range.
4. The result is stored in a variable called `total`.
5. Finally, the code uses an f-string (a new way of formatting strings in Python) to create a string that includes the calculated total value. The string is formatted with the phrase "Suma liczb od 1 do 100 wynosi: " followed by the actual total value.
6. The function returns this formatted string.

**What problems does it solve?**
This code solves the problem of calculating the sum of a range of numbers, which can be useful in various applications such as mathematical calculations, data analysis, or even simple games.

**How it works under the hood:**

* The `range()` function uses an algorithm to generate the sequence of numbers efficiently. It does not actually create all the numbers in memory, but rather generates them on-the-fly.
* The `sum()` function uses a similar algorithm to calculate the sum, which is optimized for large ranges of numbers.

Overall, this code demonstrates some basic concepts in Python programming, such as:

* Defining a reusable function (in this case, `execute()`)
* Using built-in functions like `range()` and `sum()`
* Formatting strings with f-strings
* Returning values from a function

I hope this explanation helps you understand the code!
