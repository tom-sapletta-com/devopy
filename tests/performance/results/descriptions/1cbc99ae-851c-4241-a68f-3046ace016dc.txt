Here's a detailed explanation of the Python code:

**What does the code do?**

The code defines a single function called `execute()`. When this function is called, it returns a string that displays the current date and time in a specific format.

**How does the code work?**

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The first line, `def execute():`, defines a new function called `execute()`.
2. Inside the function, the code imports the `datetime` module using the `import` statement. This module provides functionality for working with dates and times.
3. The code then creates a variable `now` by calling the `now()` method of the `datetime` module. This returns the current date and time as a `datetime.datetime` object.
4. Finally, the code uses the `strftime()` method to format the `now` object into a string that displays the current date and time in the desired format (`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`). The resulting string is assigned to the `execute()` function's return value.

**What are the main features of this code?**

1. **Importing the datetime module**: The code imports the `datetime` module, which provides essential functionality for working with dates and times.
2. **Getting the current date and time**: The code uses the `now()` method to get the current date and time as a `datetime.datetime` object.
3. **Formatting the date and time**: The code uses the `strftime()` method to format the `now` object into a string that displays the current date and time in a specific format.

**What problems does this code solve?**

This code solves the problem of obtaining the current date and time in a specific format, which can be useful in various applications such as logging, reporting, or user feedback.

**How can you use this code?**

To use this code, simply call the `execute()` function and assign its return value to a variable. For example:
```python
result = execute()
print(result)
```
This would print the current date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
